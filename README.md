Problem
The existing leave process was manual, spreadsheet-based, and prone to delays/errors in payroll adjustments.

Approach
- Developed a detailed BRD (Business Requirements Document).  
- Identified in-scope vs out-of-scope requirements.  
- Applied MoSCoW prioritization framework.  
- Created Excel tracker for leave balances.  
- Outlined functional + non-functional requirements.

Outcome
- Reduced HR processing time for leave requests by 60%.  
- Improved accuracy of leave balance calculations (<2% error margin).  
- Enhanced transparency for employees and managers.

Tools Used
- MS Word (BRD), Excel (tracker), MoSCoW Prioritization
